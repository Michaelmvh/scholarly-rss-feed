# Scholarly RSS feed generator

Generates a single RSS feed of recent scientific publications for one or more authors
**and/or journals**, sorted newest-first. Data is parsed from
[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) (a free, open catalog of scholarly works — no API key
required). The project's original Google Scholar scraper is retained as an archived fallback
provider that can be enabled with one environment variable.

Feeds can be defined in a config file so a feed URL never has to change. Each URL provides a
lightweight browser reader by default and raw RSS through the `rss` query parameter, making it
convenient to use both on the web and in a display such as a
[TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com) via its RSS plugin.

This project was originally based on
[Julien-cpsn/google-scholar-rss-feed](https://github.com/Julien-cpsn/google-scholar-rss-feed)
and has since been redesigned around OpenAlex. Its Google Scholar scraping behavior is
preserved and hardened in [`src/google_scholar.rs`](./src/google_scholar.rs). The original
copyright and MIT license notice are retained in [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).

## Deployment overview

The repository and published container are available at:

- **Source:** <https://github.com/Michaelmvh/scholarly-rss-feed>
- **Container:** <https://github.com/Michaelmvh/scholarly-rss-feed/pkgs/container/scholarly-rss-feed>
- **Image:** `ghcr.io/michaelmvh/scholarly-rss-feed:latest`

The production update path is:

```text
Edit code or feeds.toml
        |
        v
Push to GitHub main
        |
        v
GitHub Actions builds linux/amd64 and publishes to GHCR
        |
        v
The NAS pulls the new image and recreates the container
```

The application and `feeds.toml` are both baked into the image. The NAS therefore needs only
[`NAS/docker-compose.yml`](./NAS/docker-compose.yml) and a private `.env` containing the
Cloudflare token. It does not clone the source or compile Rust.

The image and Compose file update independently:

- **Code or feed changes:** push to GitHub, then pull the new GHCR image on the NAS.
- **Deployment changes:** upload the changed `NAS/docker-compose.yml` to the NAS and recreate
  the Container Manager project. GHCR cannot update the Compose file itself.

## Feed configuration

Named feeds live in [`feeds.toml`](./feeds.toml), keeping the public URL stable when authors,
journals, or topics change.

Set `GSRF_MAILTO` to a real contact address before production use. OpenAlex uses it for its
polite API pool; it is sent to OpenAlex but is not included in the RSS feed or baked into the
container image.

```toml
default_feed = "myfield"           # served at bare "/"

[settings]
from_days = 365                    # default recency window

[feeds.myfield]
title = "Machine Learning & Synthetic Biology"

[[feeds.myfield.people]]
name = "David Baker"
openalex_id = "A5135542215"

[[feeds.myfield.people]]
name = "Jeff Nivala"
openalex_id = "A5005023517"

[feeds.synbio]
title = "Synthetic Biology"
author_ids = ["A5135542215", "A5005023517"]

# Journal-only feeds are also supported.
[feeds.top-journals]
title = "Top Journals"
source_ids = ["S137773608", "S64187185"]
```

Per-feed keys:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `title` | Optional RSS channel title |
| `people` | Canonical author records shared by all providers |
| `curated_sources` | Curated paper collections merged into the feed |
| `biorxiv_categories` | Native bioRxiv categories merged into the feed |
| `arxiv_categories` | Native arXiv categories merged into the feed |
| `orcids` | ORCIDs resolved to OpenAlex author IDs |
| `authors` | Author names resolved by top search result; imprecise for common names |
| `source_ids` | OpenAlex journal/source IDs; preferred |
| `issns` | ISSNs resolved to OpenAlex source IDs |
| `journals` | Journal names resolved by top search result |
| `topics` | OpenAlex topic IDs used to narrow results |
| `from_days` | Feed-specific rolling recency window in days |
| `from` | Explicit earliest publication date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format |

Each `people` entry accepts:

| Key | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `name` | Required canonical name and default Google Scholar query |
| `openalex_id` | Optional precise OpenAlex author ID |
| `google_scholar_name` | Optional Scholar query spelling when it differs from `name` |

The legacy `author_ids`, `authors`, and `google_scholar_authors` arrays remain supported for
existing configuration files, but new feeds should use `people`.

A feed requires at least one author or journal. If both are present, results are the **union**
of the authors' publications and recent publications in the journals. Results are
de-duplicated and sorted newest-first. A topic filter applies to both sides of the union.

OpenAlex sometimes stores a preprint and its published paper as separate works, and it
occasionally mints two author entities for the same person. The feed groups records when they
share a DOI, or when their normalized titles match **and** either their complete OpenAlex
author-ID sets or their normalized author-name sets match. Name comparison is order-, case- and
initial-insensitive (`Tang, Sophia` == `S. Tang`). It retains the version with an open PDF, then
an abstract, then published status, then the newest date. Links to the other versions are
included in the retained item's description. Records whose titles or author lists cannot be
compared are kept separate rather than risking a false match.

The config is read on every request. Identical resolved queries are cached for up to one hour.
Restarting clears generated feeds and in-memory provider data, while the curated source snapshot
survives through `GSRF_CACHE_DIR`. In Docker, changing the repository copy of `feeds.toml`
requires publishing and deploying a new image because the file is baked into that image.

### Switching providers

OpenAlex is the default and recommended provider. To use the archived Google Scholar scraper,
set:

```env
GSRF_PROVIDER=google-scholar
```

Then restart or recreate the application. The public reader and RSS URLs do not change. Set
`GSRF_PROVIDER=openalex` and restart to switch back.

Each named feed intended to support both providers should define `people` records. Scholar uses
each person's canonical `name` unless `google_scholar_name` overrides it, while OpenAlex uses
`openalex_id`. The production `bioml` feed has been migrated to this format. Ad-hoc `?author=`
values also work with the Google Scholar provider. Journal, source, ORCID, and topic filters
are OpenAlex-only.

Google Scholar does not provide a supported public API. This fallback uses the project's
original unofficial HTML scraper and can be blocked or broken by markup changes. Provider
errors return HTTP 502 and are logged rather than silently returning an empty feed. The switch
is intentionally explicit instead of automatic so an OpenAlex outage cannot unexpectedly
trigger many Google Scholar requests. Google Scholar exposes only a publication year in these
results, so the `from` cutoff is truncated to that year when this provider is active.

### Curated protein-design papers

The default `bioml` feed includes recent stable-ID papers from
[Peldom/papers_for_protein_design_using_DL](https://github.com/Peldom/papers_for_protein_design_using_DL):

```text
http://localhost:3005/
http://localhost:3005/?rss
```

The named `protein-design-archive` feed retains the complete accepted history:

```text
http://localhost:3005/?feed=protein-design-archive
http://localhost:3005/?feed=protein-design-archive&rss
```

This source is independent of the selected OpenAlex or Google Scholar provider. The default
feed applies its normal one-year cutoff before merging and deduplicating curated and provider
records. Tracked authors are highlighted on curated-only records using normalized exact-name
matching against canonical names and configured aliases.

Curated ingestion includes entries with an explicit DOI, bioRxiv DOI (`10.1101` or
`10.64898`), or arXiv ID.
Entries without a stable identifier and entries marked unavailable are skipped. Benchmarks and
datasets (section 0), small-molecule models (section 7.3), and unclassified commercial reports
(section 7.5) remain intentionally excluded after Phase 4 review. No-ID entries are not matched
by title because an incorrect scholarly match is worse than an omitted record; selected entries
may be added later only after manually verifying a DOI or arXiv identifier.

The upstream Markdown is fetched at most once every 24 hours with conditional ETag requests,
a 2 MiB response limit, and the shared provider timeouts. Invalid updates do not replace a
successfully parsed snapshot. The archive displays upstream section provenance and links back
to the curated source; the GPL-licensed README itself is not copied into this repository.
Publication dates preserve the precision available in the source list: bioRxiv identifiers
provide an exact day, modern arXiv identifiers provide a year and month, and citations that
only state a year use January 1 as an explicit year-only placeholder.

If an accepted paper has no publication date, the service reads the public GitHub blame data
for that paper's title line and records the associated commit date separately. The reader
labels this fallback **Added to collection** and links to the commit; it is never presented as
the publication date or emitted as the RSS publication date. The collection date can still
qualify and sort an otherwise undated paper within a recent feed. Blame metadata is fetched
only when undated entries exist and is cached with the 24-hour curated-source snapshot.

When OpenAlex is the active provider, curated DOI and arXiv identifiers are resolved in bounded
batches to add canonical dates, abstracts, venues, open-access PDFs, and publication-version
relationships. Matching uses stable identifiers only. If enrichment fails, the direct curated
records remain available and the error is logged.

Set `GSRF_CACHE_DIR` to persist the complete parsed source snapshot, including collection-date
provenance, across restarts. Docker uses `/cache`; both Compose files mount the
`scholar-rss-cache` named volume there. Snapshot replacement is atomic, malformed or undersized
snapshots are rejected, and a network failure uses the last successfully parsed snapshot.
Persistent discovery snapshots use a versioned envelope that records their source, schema,
refresh time, coverage date, works, and source-specific cursor metadata. Native repository
integrations can therefore refresh overlapping date windows, merge duplicates, and enforce
retention without rebuilding their full history.

Curated coverage can be evaluated independently of generated feed output:

```sh
cargo run -- --compare-curated bioml peldom-protein-design --config feeds.toml
```

The command fetches the configured provider records and compares them with recent
curated papers using the feed's normal cutoff. Its Markdown report includes DOI and
title/author overlap, unique curated discoveries, version-merged volume, metadata gaps,
provider enrichment opportunities, section distribution, and all-time parser exclusions. It
does not modify configuration or feed output. Known false positives found during manual review
are excluded by stable identifier and reported separately from structural parser exclusions.
Set `GSRF_PROVIDER` to compare against the explicit Google Scholar fallback instead of OpenAlex.

### Finding reliable OpenAlex IDs

Prefer IDs over names because author profiles can be conflated or fragmented:

```text
https://api.openalex.org/authors?search=Jeff%20Nivala
https://api.openalex.org/sources?search=Nature%20Communications
https://api.openalex.org/topics?search=synthetic%20biology
```

OpenAlex URLs and bare IDs are both accepted and normalized, for example
`https://openalex.org/A5005023517` and `A5005023517`.

## Feed URLs

After starting the service:

- Default configured reader: `http://localhost:3005/`
- Default configured raw RSS: `http://localhost:3005/?rss`
- Named feed reader: `http://localhost:3005/?feed=myfield`
- Named feed raw RSS: `http://localhost:3005/?feed=myfield&rss`
- Protein-design archive: `http://localhost:3005/?feed=protein-design-archive`
- Multiple ad-hoc authors:
  `http://localhost:3005/?author_id=A5135542215&author_id=A5005023517`
- Default reader with optional native preprints:
  `http://localhost:3005/?biorxiv_category=synthetic_biology&arxiv_category=q-bio.BM`
- The same optional sources as raw RSS:
  `http://localhost:3005/?biorxiv_category=synthetic_biology&arxiv_category=q-bio.BM&rss`
- Preprints only:
  `http://localhost:3005/?paper_sources=custom&paper_source=biorxiv:synthetic_biology&paper_source=arxiv:q-bio.BM`

All identifier parameters are repeatable and are merged with a selected named feed:

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `feed` | Name under `[feeds.<name>]` in `feeds.toml` |
| `author_id` | OpenAlex author ID |
| `orcid` | ORCID resolved to an OpenAlex author |
| `author` | Author name resolved using the top search result |
| `source_id` | OpenAlex journal/source ID |
| `issn` | ISSN resolved to an OpenAlex source |
| `journal` | Journal name resolved using the top search result |
| `topic` | OpenAlex topic ID used to constrain results |
| `concept` | Alias for `topic` |
| `from` | Earliest publication date, `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `biorxiv_category` | Repeatable optional bioRxiv category; none are selected by default |
| `arxiv_category` | Repeatable optional arXiv category; none are selected by default |
| `native_days` | Native-source window from 1–30 days; defaults to 7 for query-selected categories |
| `paper_sources` | Set to `custom` when explicitly choosing paper sources |
| `paper_source` | Repeatable source selection generated by the reader: `core`, `curated:<key>`, `biorxiv:<category>`, or `arxiv:<category>` |
| `view_period` | Browser-only date filter: `30d`, `90d`, or `1y` |
| `view_author` | Repeatable browser-only tracked-author filter generated by the reader controls |
| `view_source` | Legacy browser-only curated-collection result filter |
| `rss` | Return raw RSS XML instead of the browser reader |

The browser reader is server-rendered HTML with no third-party assets. A small first-party script
applies single-select filters when they change and multiselect filters when they close; the same
controls retain an Apply button when JavaScript is unavailable. Date and author controls narrow
already-loaded publications without another provider request. The **Paper sources** control
chooses which discovery pipelines contribute records and therefore refreshes the feed. Its core
provider and configured curated collection are selected by default; native categories are not.
Unchecking both core sources and choosing native categories produces a preprint-only reader.
Multiple selected authors and paper sources use OR semantics within their respective groups.
Selections are preserved when opening an article, returning to the reader, and opening its
corresponding raw RSS. At least one paper source remains selected; an empty no-JavaScript
submission restores the configured defaults. Parameter-free reader and RSS URLs retain the
focused default feed.

Available bioRxiv values are `synthetic_biology`, `bioinformatics`, `bioengineering`,
`systems_biology`, `genomics`, `biochemistry`, and `molecular_biology`. Available arXiv values
are `q-bio.BM`, `q-bio.QM`, `q-bio.GN`, `q-bio.MN`, `q-bio.PE`, and `physics.bio-ph`.
Unfiltered `cs.LG` is intentionally unavailable because its volume and subject breadth would
overwhelm the focused feed.
Selecting a publication opens an internal preview page
on a unique `/article/<id>` path with its abstract and links to the original article and any
available open-access PDF. Unique paths prevent browser reading modes from reusing a different
page's extracted content. Tracked authors are highlighted in both views using provider IDs when
available and canonical names or configured aliases for curated records; if several tracked
authors contributed, each is highlighted.
Raw RSS has CORS enabled. The generated channel has a 60-minute TTL, and the in-memory cache is
cleared hourly.

## Running locally

### Native Rust

Install Rust with `rustup`, then run:

```sh
cargo run
# http://127.0.0.1:3005/?feed=myfield
```

The optional positional argument changes the bind address, and `--config` changes the config
path:

```sh
cargo run -- "0.0.0.0:3005" --config feeds.toml
GSRF_CONFIG=feeds.toml GSRF_MAILTO=you@example.com GSRF_PROVIDER=openalex cargo run
```

Useful development checks:

```sh
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

The test suite uses local fixtures and constructed provider records; it does not contact
OpenAlex or Google Scholar. It covers provider selection, Google Scholar result conversion,
feed configuration, curated-source parsing and evaluation, version deduplication,
provider-neutral author highlighting, RSS conversion, HTML escaping, and article previews.

### Local Docker Compose

[`local/docker-compose.yml`](./local/docker-compose.yml) publishes port `3005` and can either
pull the GHCR image or build the current checkout.

Pull and run the published image:

```sh
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.yml pull
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Build and run the current source:

```sh
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

Inspect or stop it:

```sh
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.yml logs -f
docker compose -f local/docker-compose.yml down
```

The local Compose file contains a commented bind mount for `feeds.toml`. Enable it when config
changes should be visible without rebuilding the image; restart the container to clear any
cached feed immediately. Set `GSRF_MAILTO` and, optionally, `GSRF_PROVIDER` in your shell or in
a repository-root `.env` file before starting Compose.

## GitHub Actions and GHCR

The [`Publish Docker image`](./.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) workflow runs when:

- A commit is pushed to `main`
- A tag beginning with `v` is pushed
- It is manually started from **GitHub → Actions → Publish Docker image → Run workflow**

It uses the repository's built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN`; no registry secret is required. Published
tags include `latest` for `main`, branch/semantic-version tags where applicable, and an
immutable `sha-...` tag for each build. The image targets `linux/amd64`, matching the Synology
DS423+.

After pushing a change, verify the workflow succeeded in the repository's **Actions** tab
before expecting the NAS to find a new image.

### Package visibility

For anonymous NAS pulls, set the package to public once:

**GitHub profile → Packages → scholarly-rss-feed → Package settings → Change visibility
→ Public**

To keep it private instead, authenticate the NAS using a GitHub personal access token with
`read:packages`:

```sh
echo "YOUR_PAT" | /usr/local/bin/docker login ghcr.io \
  --username Michaelmvh --password-stdin
```

## Synology NAS and Cloudflare Tunnel

The production file is [`NAS/docker-compose.yml`](./NAS/docker-compose.yml). It runs:

- `scholar-rss`: the prebuilt GHCR application image, available only to the Compose network.
- `scholar-rss-tunnel`: Cloudflare's connector, which provides public HTTPS access.

No router port forwarding is needed, and port `3005` is not published on the NAS.

### Prerequisites

- Synology Container Manager installed on the DS423+.
- The GHCR package is public, or the NAS is authenticated to GHCR.
- `michaelmvh.com` is active in Cloudflare DNS.
- A Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnel and token.

### GitHub Pages DNS safety

The existing GitHub Pages site can coexist with the tunnel:

- Keep the four GitHub Pages `A` records and the `www` CNAME set to **DNS only** (grey cloud).
- Keep mail records such as MX, SPF, DKIM, and domain-verification records DNS only.
- Only the tunnel hostname, `reading.michaelmvh.com`, should be proxied by Cloudflare.
- The tunnel hostname is independent of the apex and `www` records used by GitHub Pages.

### First-time deployment

1. In **Cloudflare Zero Trust → Networks → Tunnels**, create or open the tunnel.
2. Add a published application/public hostname:
   - Hostname: `reading.michaelmvh.com`
   - Service type: `HTTP`
   - Service URL: `scholar-rss:3005`
3. Copy only the tunnel token from Cloudflare's installation command. Do not run that command;
   the Compose file already runs `cloudflared`.
4. In Synology File Station, create:

   ```text
   /volume1/docker/scholar-rss/
   ```

5. Upload [`NAS/docker-compose.yml`](./NAS/docker-compose.yml) directly into that directory.
   No rename is required.
6. Create a plain-text file named `.env` beside it:

   ```env
   TUNNEL_TOKEN=eyJ...
   GSRF_PROVIDER=openalex
   ```

   The resulting directory must contain:

   ```text
   /volume1/docker/scholar-rss/
   ├── docker-compose.yml
   └── .env
   ```

   `.env` may be hidden in File Station. Enable **Settings → General → Show hidden files** if
   necessary.
7. Open **Container Manager → Project → Create**:
   - Project name: `scholar-rss`
   - Path: `/volume1/docker/scholar-rss`
   - Source: existing `docker-compose.yml`
8. Build/start the project and confirm both `scholar-rss` and `scholar-rss-tunnel` are running.
9. Open the browser reader:

   ```text
   https://reading.michaelmvh.com/
   ```

10. Configure the TRMNL RSS plugin with the raw feed URL:

    ```text
    https://reading.michaelmvh.com/?rss
    ```

    The URL remains stable when the default named feed's contents change.

### Automatic image updates

Container Manager does not automatically pull or redeploy a changed `latest` image when a
container is stopped and started. The NAS uses a scheduled user-defined script named
**Update Scholar RSS**:

- Run as: `root`
- Schedule: weekly
- Script:

```sh
cd /volume1/docker/scholar-rss &&
/usr/local/bin/docker compose pull &&
/usr/local/bin/docker compose up -d --remove-orphans
```

This updates both the application and `cloudflared`. It leaves the existing containers running
if pulling an image fails because the commands are chained with `&&`.

For an immediate application update, explicitly pull the image and force recreation; merely
uploading Compose or restarting the existing container can reuse the old local image:

```sh
cd /volume1/docker/scholar-rss &&
/usr/local/bin/docker compose pull scholar-rss &&
/usr/local/bin/docker compose up -d --force-recreate scholar-rss
```

Alternatively, use **Pull** and rebuild the project in Container Manager.

### Updating the Compose configuration

The scheduled task updates images, not `docker-compose.yml`. If
[`NAS/docker-compose.yml`](./NAS/docker-compose.yml) changes:

1. Download or upload the new file from GitHub over the existing NAS copy.
2. Keep the existing `.env`; it contains the tunnel secret.
3. Pull and recreate the project so both the new Compose settings and latest images take
   effect:

   ```sh
   cd /volume1/docker/scholar-rss &&
   /usr/local/bin/docker compose pull &&
   /usr/local/bin/docker compose up -d --force-recreate --remove-orphans
   ```

### Rollback

Every successful workflow build publishes an immutable `sha-...` image tag. To roll back:

1. Find the desired tag on the GitHub package page.
2. Change the NAS Compose image temporarily:

   ```yaml
   image: ghcr.io/michaelmvh/scholarly-rss-feed:sha-abcdef0
   ```

3. Pull and recreate the project.
4. Change it back to `:latest` after the problem is fixed.

## Caching and request load

Normal TRMNL polling will not overwhelm the NAS. The generated RSS channel for each resolved
query is cached in memory for up to one hour. A cache hit only clones and serializes the
already-built channel; it does not call a provider again. A cold OpenAlex request makes at most
one author query and one journal query, concurrently. A cold Google Scholar request makes one
query per configured person, sequentially. Concurrent requests for the same uncached feed
share one in-flight build instead of duplicating provider traffic, and provider requests use
finite connection and total timeouts.

Use stable OpenAlex IDs in `feeds.toml` and give TRMNL a named feed URL such as
`https://reading.michaelmvh.com/?feed=myfield&rss`. Name, ORCID, ISSN, and journal-name parameters
must be resolved before the channel-cache lookup and can therefore cause extra OpenAlex calls.

Current limitations:

- Cloudflare Tunnel transports requests but does not automatically cache this dynamic RSS URL.
- The application has no rate limiter.
- Different ad-hoc parameters create different cache entries until the hourly cache clear.

These limitations are not significant for ordinary TRMNL use, but Cloudflare can cheaply
protect the public endpoint:

1. In Cloudflare, open **Caching → Cache Rules → Create rule**.
2. Name the rule `Cache reading RSS feed`.
3. Use the expression:

   ```text
   (http.host eq "reading.michaelmvh.com")
   ```

4. Set **Cache eligibility** to **Eligible for cache**.
5. Set an **Edge TTL** of two hours. The application sends
   `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, s-maxage=7200, stale-while-revalidate=86400` so browsers
   may cache for five minutes and shared caches may retain a response for two hours.
6. Keep query strings in the cache key so different named feeds remain separate.

Cloudflare's first request for a URL is a cache miss and reaches the NAS; subsequent requests
for that exact URL are served at the edge until expiration. Verify the rule by requesting the
same URL twice and inspecting `CF-Cache-Status`:

```sh
curl -sI "https://reading.michaelmvh.com/?feed=myfield" | grep -i cf-cache-status
curl -sI "https://reading.michaelmvh.com/?feed=myfield" | grep -i cf-cache-status
```

The first response should normally be `MISS` and a later response `HIT`. `DYNAMIC` or `BYPASS`
means the Cache Rule is not applying.

After deploying a feed change that must appear immediately, use **Cloudflare → Caching →
Configuration → Purge Cache → Custom Purge** for the feed URL. Otherwise, allow up to the edge
TTL for the cached response to expire.

Edge caching protects repeated URLs, but unique query strings can still force cache misses.
As an additional abuse safeguard, create a Cloudflare rate-limiting rule:

1. Open **Security → WAF → Rate limiting rules**.
2. Match hostname `reading.michaelmvh.com`.
3. Set a limit such as 60 requests per minute per client IP.
4. Block or challenge the client briefly after exceeding the limit.

This threshold is far above normal RSS polling while preventing one client from continuously
generating unique ad-hoc queries. Availability and exact limits depend on the Cloudflare plan.
Do not place Cloudflare Access login in front of the feed unless the TRMNL client is configured
to supply the required credentials.

## Security and recovery

- Never commit `.env` or the Cloudflare tunnel token. `.env` is ignored by Git.
- If the token is exposed, rotate it in Cloudflare and replace the NAS `.env` value.
- The public RSS endpoint has no application authentication. Do not put private information in
  feed titles or configuration.
- Do not open or forward port `3005` on the router; the tunnel is the public entry point.
- Repository code, feed definitions, Compose configuration, and image history are stored on
  GitHub/GHCR. The only NAS-specific secret to preserve is `.env`.
- To recover on a replacement NAS, install Container Manager, upload
  `NAS/docker-compose.yml`, create `.env` with a valid tunnel token, and create the project.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
|---|---|
| GHCR pull returns `unauthorized` or `denied` | Make the package public or run `docker login ghcr.io` with a token containing `read:packages`. |
| Compose reports `TUNNEL_TOKEN` is unset | Confirm `.env` is beside `docker-compose.yml`, is named exactly `.env`, and contains `TUNNEL_TOKEN=value` without spaces around `=`. |
| Tunnel shows disconnected | Check the `scholar-rss-tunnel` logs and confirm its token is current. |
| Cloudflare returns HTTP 502 | Confirm `scholar-rss` is running and the Cloudflare service URL is exactly `http://scholar-rss:3005`, not `localhost`. |
| Public hostname has a certificate warning during DNS setup | Wait until the domain is active. GitHub Pages records should remain DNS only; the tunnel hostname should be proxied. |
| Feed content appears stale | Feeds are cached for up to one hour. Restart `scholar-rss` to clear the cache immediately. |
| A pushed feed change does not appear | Confirm GitHub Actions succeeded, then confirm the NAS pulled and recreated the new `latest` image. |
| A local `feeds.toml` change does not appear in Docker | Rebuild the image, or enable the bind mount in `local/docker-compose.yml` and restart the container. |
| An author returns unrelated papers | Replace name lookup with a precise OpenAlex author ID or ORCID, and optionally add topic IDs. |
